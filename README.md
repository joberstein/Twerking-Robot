Instructions and Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Move the mouse to control R.O.B. (the robot).  He will accelerate toward the mouse and will stop once he reaches it.  R.O.Bâ€™s movement is bounded by the screen edges, and he cannot go below the stage.

If R.O.B. leaves the ground, the background tints to a pink color, the platforms begin to move, and R.O.B. starts to wiggle around (tweak) in a strange manner.  While in the air, he can light any of the three bushes on fire.  Flames on bushes are extinguished after a number of seconds, and can be set ablaze again afterwards.  To return the stage and R.O.B. to their static forms, simply land R.O.B. on the ground.
